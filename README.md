# Advanced Data Processing Techniques - Tuwaiq Academy 🇸🇦

This repository contains the practical tasks and projects completed during the **Advanced Data Processing Techniques** program at **Tuwaiq Academy**.

## 📂 Projects & Tasks

### 1. Big Data Analysis with PySpark
- **File:** `Abdulaziz_pySpark.ipynb`
- **Techniques:** Big Data processing, Pipeline construction, Feature Engineering (`VectorAssembler`, `StandardScaler`), and Machine Learning (`Logistic Regression`).
- **Description:** Processing large datasets and building scalable machine learning models using the **PySpark** framework.
- **Dataset:** `flightsData.csv` (⚠️ Not included due to size limitations).

### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Task 2
- **File:** `Abdulaziz_TasK2_V2.ipynb`
- **Techniques:** Text Preprocessing, Language Detection (`langdetect`), Topic Modeling (`Gensim`), and Sentiment Analysis.
- **Tools:** NLTK, Scikit-learn, Gensim.
- **Description:** Advanced text analysis and modeling to extract insights from unstructured text data (LinkedIn Job Posts).
- **Dataset:** `Linkedin Job Posts.csv` (⚠️ Not included due to size limitations).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Task 1
- **File:** `Abdulaziz_Task1_2.ipynb`
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, Visualization, and Statistical Analysis.
- **Tools:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Description:** Analyzing the "Salaries" dataset to uncover trends and patterns using Python libraries.
- **Dataset:** `Salaries.csv` (✅ Included in repository).

## ⚠️ Note on Datasets
- **Included:** The dataset `Salaries.csv` is available in this repository.
- **Not Included:** Larger datasets such as `flightsData.csv` and `Linkedin Job Posts` are **not included** due to file size limitations. However, the notebooks are saved with **executed outputs** to show the results and analysis without needing the data files.
